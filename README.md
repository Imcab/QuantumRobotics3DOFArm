### Chart

To the left you have the chart of the robotic arm and its position respective to X and Y

### Forward Kinematics

In the Forward Kinematics panel you can manipulate each joint angle either with the slides or entering manually on the number input, also there are buttons that change into predifined positions of the arm.

Angles **must be between -180 to 180 degrees.**

### Inverse Kinematics

On the right panel you have the IK controlls where you can enter a final X, Y, Rot position for the arm to achieve, also you can change for the aligment of the elbow (UP/DOWN), for the arm to achieve the desired position **you must click on the submit button.**

### End Effector Controll

**Hold** the button to rotate the end effector in the desired rotation.

## Extra

There is a Python script for testing!
