### Chart

On the left, you will find the chart of the robotic arm and its position respective to the X and Y axes.

### Forward Kinematics

In the Forward Kinematics panel you can manipulate each joint angle, either with the slides or entering manually the number input. Moreover, there are buttons to change any position of the arm into predefined positions.
Angles must be between -180 and 180 degrees.

Angles **must be between -180 to 180 degrees.**

### Inverse Kinematics

On the right panel you have the IK controls, where you can enter any desired coordinate on X, Y and Rotation for the arm to achieve; you can also change the alignment of the elbow (UP/DOWN). For the arm to achieve the goal position, you must click on the submit button.

### End Effector Controll

**Hold** the button to make the end effector rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise.

## Extra

There is a Python script for testing!
